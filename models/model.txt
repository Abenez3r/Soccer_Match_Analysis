Recommend method to train model (even with a system that has a gpu)

Step 1: Search and open Google Colab
Create a new notebook by clicking "File" > "New Notebook".

Step 2: Copy and paste the cells from the football_training_yolo-v8.ipynb notebook onto a Google Colab Notebook 

This will:
Install Required Libraries
You'll need to install two libraries: ultralytics and roboflow. You can install them directly in Google Colab by running the following command in a new cell:
 
    !pip install ultralytics
    !pip install roboflow  # Library used to download the dataset


Download the Dataset
Youâ€™ll use Roboflow to fetch the dataset for football player detection. Here's how to do it:
Add your API Key to the following code where it says "your_api_key_here".
To retrieve an API KEY you will need to create a free Roboflow account then...
    1. Go to the Roboflow dashboard. 
    2. In the left navigation bar, click on "Settings" and then "API Keys"
    3. You will be taken to a page with your API Keys. They are scoped to a workspace so you must use the API Key associated with a workspace to access that workspace's private projects
    4. On the left sidebar, you will see a list of workspaces. Select the workspace for which you want to issue an API Key.
    5. Copy your Private API Key

This code will fetch the dataset version and download it.

    from roboflow import Roboflow
    rf = Roboflow(api_key="your_api_key_here")  # Replace with your actual API key from 
    project = rf.workspace("roboflow-jvuqo").project("football-players-detection-3zvbc")
    version = project.version(1)
    dataset = version.download("yolov8")

# Print Dataset Location
Verify Dataset Download Location
The downloaded dataset's location will be stored in dataset.location. You can check by adding print:

(dataset.location)

# Move Dataset Folders for YOLOv8 Training
This code moves the train, test, and valid folders to an appropriate directory for the YOLOv8 training format.
In your training process, you're moving directories to organize the dataset properly. Ensure the dataset is correctly structured by running this:

import shutil

shutil.move('football-players-detection-1/train',
            'football-players-detection-1/football-players-detection-1/train')

shutil.move('football-players-detection-1/test',
            'football-players-detection-1/football-players-detection-1/test')

shutil.move('football-players-detection-1/valid',
            'football-players-detection-1/football-players-detection-1/valid')

# Train the YOLOv8 Model
You will now use the yolov8x.pt pre-trained model and train it on your dataset.
This command specifies:
Task: Object detection (task=detect).
Mode: Training mode (mode=train).
Model: Pre-trained YOLOv8x model (yolov8x.pt).
Data: YAML file path for the dataset (data={dataset.location}/data.yaml).
Epochs: Number of training epochs (epochs=100).
Image size: Resized image dimensions (imgsz=640).

Use the following command to initiate the training process:
    !yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8x.pt data={dataset.location}/data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640

Step 3: After the model is finished, click the folder image at the bottom of the icon list on the left side of your screen

Step 4: There should be a "runs" folder if it isn't there you can press refresh under "Files". Click runs > detect > train > weights > best.pt & last.pt

Step 5: Click the three bullets on the right of best.pt & last.pt and download both 

Step 6: Save both trained models in this "models" folder
